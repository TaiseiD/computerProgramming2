# MyMidtermLabExam â€“ IT Ticketing System (Console-Based)

This project is a simple **console-based IT Helpdesk Ticketing System** written in Java. It allows a user to add tickets, update their statuses, view all tickets, and generate a report of the current ticket status.

Designed for midterm lab practice, the application uses core Java features such as arrays, conditionals, loops, methods, and `Scanner` for user input.

- Add a new ticket (up to a maximum of 5)
- Assign urgency level: Low / Medium / High
- Auto-initialized ticket status to `Pending`

## ðŸ§  Ticket Structure

Each ticket contains the following:

- **Issue Description**
- **Urgency Level** â€“ `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`
- **Status** â€“ `Pending`, `In Progress`, or `Resolved`

Stored using 3 parallel arrays:
```java

## ðŸ™Œ Author's Note

This program was created for a **Midterm Lab Exam** and is designed to apply foundational programming skills including:

- Working with arrays
- Structuring a menu-driven console application
- Using loops, conditionals, and methods
- Managing user input and data flow cleanly

Feel free to build on top of this structure for future Java console applications or use it as a base for GUI versions.
