The javacalculator is the main folder to run the calculator, the png is needed because it's the background of the calculator. the buttons are clear so without png you can't see the calculator.
the JavaCalculator is the one who's calling the mainCalculator to function.

To run the calculator properly, the JavaCalculator.java , background.png , mainCalculator.java , mainCalculator.form must be in a folder named javacalculator and put it inside another folder
(name it javacalculator) and that folder (the one containing the javacalculator folder with four file) is the one you will open in a compiller.
