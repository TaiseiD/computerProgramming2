Java Programming

Hi! This repository contains all of the Java programming activities and exams I completed throughout the semester. These projects showcase my understanding of core Java concepts, from basic syntax and console I/O to more complex topics like control structures, arrays, and GUI development using AWT and Swing.

Each activity builds on the previous one, helping me improve my skills incrementally while simulating real-world programming tasks. Below, I’ve written a brief description of each activity or exam I worked on.

Activity 1: Console-Based Employee Information System
In this first activity, I created a simple Java program that collects employee details such as name, age, hours worked, and hourly wage through user input. The program calculates the daily wage and displays the full name. This helped me get comfortable with Java's syntax, variable declarations, basic data types, and console input/output.

Activity 2: Advanced Salary Computation
Building on Activity 1, I added more calculations like retirement years, rounded daily wage, and monthly/yearly salary estimations. I also practiced using Math.abs() and rounding functions. The goal was to apply arithmetic and string operations while improving output formatting and logic flow.

Activity 3: Conditional Statements and Role Assignment
This activity introduced more decision-making logic. I used if-else statements to validate user input (like age and hours worked) and terminate the program for invalid data. I also implemented a switch statement to assign job roles based on a numeric role code. This taught me how to build more robust, user-aware applications.

Midterm Lab Exam – Problem-Solving with Arrays and Methods
For my midterm exam, I created a program that solves a practical problem using Java arrays, loops, and methods. I structured the program with reusable code and logic to meet the requirements outlined in a provided document. This exam tested my ability to design, organize, and implement a complete Java application from scratch.

Activity 4: GUI-Based Employee Info System (AWT)
This was my first GUI project using Java’s AWT framework. I built a form where users can input employee information, and the program calculates and displays the daily wage. I used layout managers, labels, text fields, and buttons, and I made sure to handle possible input errors during runtime. It was a great introduction to GUI programming.

Activity 5: GUI Quiz Application with AWT
In this activity, I developed a multiple-choice quiz app that displays one question at a time. I used arrays to store questions and answers, ActionListener to handle button clicks, and radio buttons for answer selection. The app keeps track of the score and displays it at the end, disabling the inputs after completion. This project helped me get more comfortable with event handling and dynamic GUI behavior.

Activity 6: To-Do List Application Using Swing (Multi-Window)
For this activity, I created a two-window application using Java Swing. The main window displays a JTable of tasks, and clicking "Add Task" opens a second window for entering task details. After saving, the task appears in the main table. This project taught me how to manage multiple Swing frames, pass data between them, and use components like dropdowns and text areas effectively.

Final Exam – Calculator Application Using Swing
For the final exam, I developed a fully functional calculator with a graphical interface. It supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus, along with more advanced functions like square root and exponentiation and power of. I also included features like delete and clear. It was a great opportunity to combine everything I’d learned about Java Swing and event-driven programming.
