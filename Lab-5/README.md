# LabActivity5QuizAppAWT

This project is a simple multiple-choice **Quiz Application** built using Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). It allows users to take a short quiz, select answers, and receive a score at the end.

## üìã Description

The quiz app contains:
- A window that displays one question at a time
- Four multiple-choice options using radio-style checkboxes
- A "Next" button to move to the next question
- Score display after the final question
- Basic error handling (e.g., warning when no answer is selected)

This program demonstrates how to build a basic GUI application that uses event handling, dynamic content updating, and user interaction tracking.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Java GUI built entirely with **AWT**
- Displays a total of 3 multiple-choice questions
- Options rendered as exclusive `CheckboxGroup` (radio buttons)
- "Next" button progresses to the next question
- Displays error if no option is selected
- Final score shown at the end of the quiz
- Clean and simple layout using `BorderLayout` and `GridLayout`
